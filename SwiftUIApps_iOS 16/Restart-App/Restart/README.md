# Haptic Feedback.
Haptics engages people's sense of touch to enhance the experience of interacting with on screen interfaces.
We can play various types of haptics in addition to visual and auditory feedback to enhance touch gestures
or toggling a switch.
On top of that, we can use it to highlight, deny or confirm any other user interactions.


There are many other haptic styles besides it, such

as soft, light, medium, rigid and, of course, heavy.

It's worth to mention that in iOS 13 we can create our own style as well.
