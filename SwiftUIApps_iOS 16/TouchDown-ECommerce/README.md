# TouchDown - an E-Commerce App

First of all, we will create two main screens for the storefront of the sports equipment shop.
By doing that, we will practice rapid prototyping using the Swift UI framework.
Since all design assets are already prepared for us, therefore we can focus on creating the layout
and filling up the application with some data.
we will perfect
our prototyping skills with some practical techniques such as how to store and use global properties
in a dedicated file called Constants.
Then we will learn how to create a header and footer sections for the new horizontal grid and more importantly,
how to replace simple bindings with the environment.
Object property wrapper and share properties through the whole app so we can save time and effort in the development process.
