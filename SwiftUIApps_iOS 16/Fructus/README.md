# Fructus

## SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

These SVG files can be scaled up infinitely without pixelating them and losing their quality in general.

Navigate to the resizing option at the Attributes panel on the right side in Xcode.

Here we have to select the preserved vector data in order to use this SVG as a scalable vector graphic in the fructose project.

Basically, with this setting we told Xcode to not to pixelate our logo and use the original vector file as it is.

By doing that, our logo will be always crystal clear and sharp, no matter how much we want to scale up or shrink it down.

The logo will always look perfect in this app.
