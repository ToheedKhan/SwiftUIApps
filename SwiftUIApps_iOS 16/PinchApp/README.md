## SF SYMBOL

There are 4 different rendering modes.
**Monochrome **
It applies one color to all symbols within a symbol paths render in the color we specify.
**Hierarchical**
This rendering mode assigns a different opacity of a single color to each layer, creating a visual hierarchy that gives depth to the symbol.
**Palette**
 which applies two or more contrasting colors to each symbol,
using one color per layer, specifying only two colors.
For a symbol that defines three levels of hierarchy means the secondary and tertiary layers use the
same color.
**Multi color**
This is available for only a smaller pool of symbols.
This multi color rendering applies system defined intrinsic colors to some symbols to enhance meaning.
