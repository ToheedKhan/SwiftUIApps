**SF Symbols** is a library of iconography designed to integrate seamlessly with San Francisco.

## SwiftUI 4


The new Xcode includes SwiftUI, a new Swift framework, and accompanying design tools that empower a whole new way to build user interfaces. Design tools in Xcode make it as easy as drag-and-drop to construct or edit your interface, all while instantly editing the exact same Swift code file you can also edit by hand. Xcode is constantly running your real app interface live to see how it behaves directly in the design canvas, or you can instantly preview your app on an attached device.

SwiftUI includes:

Design tools read and write the same code you edit by hand for a single source of truth

Declarative syntax defines your user interface as easy-to-read Swift code

Animations are built using simple commands that describe the action you want to see

Library of controls and modifiers make it easy to design and build complex interfaces

Share common UI code across all Apple platforms, and add custom experiences for each OS

Previews show an exact rendering across various device types and accessibility settings

Interact with your interface live in the design canvas, or on an attached device

Hot-swap your edits into a live view of your app to instantly see and interact with changes

SwiftUI provides views, controls, and layout structures for declaring your app’s user interface. The framework provides event handlers for delivering taps, gestures, and other types of input to your app, and tools to manage the flow of data from your app’s models down to the views and controls that users will see and interact with.

Define your app structure using the App protocol, and populate it with scenes that contain the views that make up your app’s user interface. Create your own custom views that conform to the View protocol, and compose them with SwiftUI views for displaying text, images, and custom shapes using stacks, lists, and more. Apply powerful modifiers to built-in views and your own views to customize their rendering and interactivity. Share code between apps on multiple platforms with views and controls that adapt to their context and presentation.
**Declarative syntax**

SwiftUI uses a declarative syntax, so you can simply state what your user interface should do.
